Thank you for everyone's prayers. 

After spending more than a week in 4 different rooms, I have finally been given the approval for discharge. Health wise, I am doing extremely well thankfully! I'll have extra follow up appointments with my doctor, but only to make sure everything continues improving as it currently is. 

Judah's story is slightly different than mine. He still has a bit of jaundice they would like to see go down before he leaves. So they're going to move him out of the NICU into a room with me on the 3rd floor for the night with the plan for him to go home tomorrow.
