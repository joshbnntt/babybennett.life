**Born 3-19-19, 1:44am 5lbs 9oz.**

To make the story of this long night short, Judah came quickly after they broke Victoria's water. So quickly, in fact, that they didn't have time for the epidural before he was already here. 

He came out crying and they took him to the NICU. He's breathing on his own and taking bottles like a champ.

Victoria is pretty exhausted and hurting obviously but doing well. We're in yet another room, this one with a pretty good view.

Thank you for all your prayers!
