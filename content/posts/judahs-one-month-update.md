It is so amazing watching our little boy grow! The miracle of life is so beautiful and never gets old for me!! This week marks Judah's due date and yet we've already celebrated one month on the outside with him. God knew all along when he would come though, and prepared all of us for it somehow.

When Judah left the NICU and came home he was just over 5 lb. Now he is 7 lb 12 oz!! He is doing so well and growing too quickly for this mama already. It's interesting comparing Dan and Judah's sizes. Dan came at 38 weeks and Judah at 34.5, so there's going to be a difference, but Judah is quickly catching up. We are now outgrowing Preemie things and starting to fill in all things newborn.

Joshua and I are exhausted, which comes with the territory, but love so much being with both of our little men! Daniel is as in love with little brother as the rest of us. He is such a blessing even though he's not yet two. Sometimes I forget he's so young because of his maturity and help at home!! He is a true blessed help from God! There definitely are a new set of challenges though having two littles, especially two under 2! Thankfully, with God's great grace and my wonderfully self-sacrificing husband, we are making it!

Thank you everyone who prayed for both mine and Judah's health in all of this. Whatever the outcome, God is good! And in this case, He had truly exceeded my prayers. Judah is so perfect and I am gaining back my health much faster post-delivery this time around, even with the added pregnancy issues. Now if we could sleep more than 3 hours, we'd be grand!! But even this is only for a season, so I do my best to remember it and enjoy the late night moments when I'm staring at my little boy though tired eyes.
