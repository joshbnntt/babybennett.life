As of this morning, my blood work is showing a slight downward move on my liver counts instead of continuing to move up. While that's a big positive because it means my condition isn't worsening, it doesn't change anything overall. I'm still here being monitored along with baby every 6 hours. Both of us have wonderfully stable vitals which is great! Still awaiting the results for Cholestasis tests. They will come in by Wednesday at the latest. I'm not showing any extreme Preeclampsia symptoms, which is another positive. Because I have both liver disorders, they are likely to play off each other, causing me to be very sick very fast (the reason I cannot go home). What the plan could be at this point: 1. Cholestasis comes back positive, our vitals stay stable, and I'll be induced at 36 weeks (I'm 34.3 now); 2. Cholestasis comes back negative, Preeclampsia assumed only cause of liver numbers, and delivery comes immediately; 3. At any point if mine or baby's vitals take a not good turn, baby will be taken via c section for both our safety. I've gone through the 48 hours of steroids for Judah's lung development, so that is a point of encouragement because he'll now be more prepared to come early, whenever that time is. _\- from Victoria_

So we are mostly just waiting and trying to spend as much time together as we can. Daniel doesn't understand why Mama can't leave with us when we go and tries to pull Victoria out of the room to go home most of the time we're there. 

We've been tremendously blessed by our church supporting us throughout this whole time with hospital visits, food, prayer, and offers to help out with Daniel or whatever else we might need. We're also blessed with our family in town helping hold down the fort at the house while I spend extra time with Victoria and getting things ready for when Judah finally comes. Thank you for your prayers! _\- from Joshua_

Yesterday morning, the doctor came and said my liver numbers were continuing to rise (normal 40s) to over 300 now. Discussions were had as to just how soon I would need to deliver based on that. Only, I'm not having any distress symptoms of preeclampsia I should have with those high of numbers. After talking with them, we discovered a symptom related to ANOTHER liver disorder, cholestasis. Blood work has been sent to the lab to confirm this new diagnosis, but could take 4-7 days for results. My symptoms are so aligned though, that it was decided for me to start med treatments for it last night (totally safe for baby). Now I have become a Monopoly with 2 liver disorders in pregnancy. If the tests come back positive, it confirms that my numbers are sky high because of the cholestasis, with preeclampsia simply just adding to it. They believe I already had it and developed preeclampsia after, which could actually be a blessing that helped me discover things before baby or I reached real danger. For now, I have already received the full steroid treatment for baby's lung development and we will both continue to be monitored every 6 hours while taking treatments for and awaiting cholestasis results. If ANYTHING changes to put baby or I at risk, delivery will be immediate. Otherwise we wait for results. Cholestasis is safe to wait for delivery at 36 weeks (I'm 34 now). Probably, we won't wait that long, but every day longer Judah can safely stay with me is a better chance for him to avoid NICU. _\-from Victoria_

We went to the hospital on Wednesday the 12th after Victoria's Doctor got some test results back and she was diagnosed with Preeclampsia. Victoria had tests over the next 8 hours. They decided to give Baby Judah steroids to help with lung development and we were told they will probably deliver no later than Thursday. -_from Joshua_
