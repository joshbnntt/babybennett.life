Yesterday morning, the doctor came and said my liver numbers were continuing to rise (normal 40s) to over 300 now. Discussions were had as to just how soon I would need to deliver based on that. Only, I'm not having any distress symptoms of preeclampsia I should have with those high of numbers. After talking with them, we discovered a symptom related to ANOTHER liver disorder, cholestasis. Blood work has been sent to the lab to confirm this new diagnosis, but could take 4-7 days for results. My symptoms are so aligned though, that it was decided for me to start med treatments for it last night (totally safe for baby). Now I have become a Monopoly with 2 liver disorders in pregnancy. If the tests come back positive, it confirms that my numbers are sky high because of the cholestasis, with preeclampsia simply just adding to it. They believe I already had it and developed preeclampsia after, which could actually be a blessing that helped me discover things before baby or I reached real danger. For now, I have already received the full steroid treatment for baby's lung development and we will both continue to be monitored every 6 hours while taking treatments for and awaiting cholestasis results. If ANYTHING changes to put baby or I at risk, delivery will be immediate. Otherwise we wait for results. Cholestasis is safe to wait for delivery at 36 weeks (I'm 34 now). Probably, we won't wait that long, but every day longer Judah can safely stay with me is a better chance for him to avoid NICU. _\-from Victoria_

We went to the hospital on Wednesday the 12th after Victoria's Doctor got some test results back and she was diagnosed with Preeclampsia. Victoria had tests over the next 8 hours. They decided to give Baby Judah steroids to help with lung development and we were told they will probably deliver no later than Thursday.
